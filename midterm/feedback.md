Nice use of docstrings and tests!

I think your comments can get a little overdone. If the code is clear about what it doing (using good variable names, etc), then you don't need to rewrite exactly what is happening on every line of code.  It's OK if you're doing this for yourself as you program, but it isn't necessary for most of your individual lines of code.


## Step 1
* No comments.

## Step 2
* No comments. I was going to comment on the poor use of `aa` as a variable name, but then realized it stood for `allowed_amount`


## Step 3
* Nice work. Most people just test `if adjusted_rate is None` rather than testing to see if it's a float.

## Step 4
* Nice work.
